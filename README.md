## Justin Richardson's Airport Map

![Map](Images/map.jpg)


In this map, I have made a choropleth out of how many airports are in each individual state, and have color coded the markers to represent which airports have air traffic control centers. I have gotten my airport data from data.gov, and am using D3's US geodata. I am also using a simplistic ESRI basemap, and have color coded the states from yellow to green.
